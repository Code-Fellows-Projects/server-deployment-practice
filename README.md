### Setup

#### `.env` requirements

- `PORT` - 3000

#### How to initialize/run your application

- `npm start` (or) `nodemon`

#### How to use your library

#### Tests

- How do you run tests?
  - The tests were written by code fellows and were run on a command line of `npm test`
- Any tests of note?
  - My code initially wouldn't pass the test but would work through live server so then I realized that my code had to match the test completely even "HELLO WORLD" for tests to pass.
